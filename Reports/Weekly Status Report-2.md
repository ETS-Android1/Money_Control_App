As per our agenda set last week, Our team met and discussed on how to proceed with the system design. We have worked on modelling the system design aspects of our project. We have used ArgoUML and Lucid-chart to model the following diagrams for our project:

- Use Case diagrams
- Sequential diagrams
- Class diagrams.

This was done with the help of all the team members. We utilised the available time to connect with each other and discuss on how to proceed further with the project.

We are learning about android studio and trying to get hands on with android studio interface.

Our goal for the remaining part of the week and the consequent week is to begin with the development of basic prototype and to be able to come up with the basic prototype by 16th of May,2021. We would be meeting again the coming weekend and discuss about how to proceed with the design. 

Also, we will be simultaneously starting with the blog and slides preparation so that they can be presented as part of our Milestone 2 which is on 23rd of May. We have also tentatively planned a meeting once the basic prototype is prepared so that it can be reviewed for any modifications.

Thanks for reading. Have a nice week ahead.

 ##ACTIVITIES OF THE PROJECT##

 Finally we have come up with the last requirement is Beta Prototype.
 So far the 3 requirements are
 Essential (different categories, time and date, filter, comment section and payment method)
 Necessary (thumbnails, deletion, budget planning, )
 Nice to Have ( visual representation, user stories, help menu, multiple currency, credit and debit addition)

Therefore, the couple of challenges were facing by the team during the previous weeks. We conducted a sprint call in which we set overall goals for the weeks and we were able to achieve most of them successfully. we continuously worked on development and other functionalities to meet the customers criteria accurately. Every week we were experiencing several difficulties which making us more experienced as a problem solver.

Finally, we have experienced lots of new things in a new way that broaden our knowledge. We are extremely happy to be a part of this program.
